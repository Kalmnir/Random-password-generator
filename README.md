# Random-password-generator
As a user of the web, it is essential to have a truely secure password for all of my accounts.
To that end, a random password generator can be an amazing tool to use to get a truely random and secured password.

Over the last week, I have gone about setting up the Javascript for a website that does just that.

##Features of the site

```
-When the generate password is hit, user is given a prompt to select the length of the password
-After selecting a length, several confirm windows ask about what options they would like the new password to contain
-Once options have been confirmed, generates a new, secure password and displays it for the user in the text box

```
